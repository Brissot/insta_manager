# insta_manager

So after doing some research, all the social media managers are random sketchy apps, or professional paid apps for organizations like Wegmans or w/e.

I want to make a social media manager as a Desktop app, with an open source code base. This may require users to provide their own api keys, but this is a small price to pay for a non-bad social media manager.
